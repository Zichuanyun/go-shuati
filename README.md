# go-shuati 

## Init
1. Clone.
2. Create your folder using your preferred name. For example "zichuanyu", "zain", "whatever".
3. Add this name to the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i4yPW0AlH2MUaUSVYs0I_ZsPsJxwWuA4TLwROc0PKjw/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Add something to your folder
  - If you want to push code to repo:
    1. Finish [Two Sum](go/shuati) with any form you like
    2. Put a file containing your solution in your folder. Push.
    3. Count 1 for yourself in the doc.
  - If you want to use screen shot:
    1. Leave a note in your folder telling us where we can find your screen shots (for example google doc/drive link).
    2. Finish Two Sum. Upload the screen shot to your own place(not this repo). Count 1 for yourself in the doc.
    3. DON'T push the pictures directly to the repo! PLEASE!
  - If you don't want to do the two things above:
    1. Leave a note in your folder containing your profile link. Could be LeetCode profile or github profile (or other).
    2. Finish Two Sum. Count 1 for yourself in the doc.
5. Cheers! You are now with us!
6. Begin to follow everyday's problems.
7. Finish the past problems if you like, but sadly you can only count 1 for each problem.

## Rule
- Count 1 for each problem you finish (push your code to this repo) before PST 23:59 count at the release date.
- Count 0.5 for each problem you finish after PST 23:59 count at the release date.

## Notice
- We will be Googlers, so be Googley. Count honestly.
- Don't touch others' content in the repo or doc.
- Contact the repo owner if you have any suggestions. 
- The rule may change, but won't change much.
- The owner of this repo may change. 
- **坚持，就是胜利！**
